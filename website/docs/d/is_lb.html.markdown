# ibm\_is_lb

Import the details of an existing IBM VPC Load Balancer as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "testvpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "testacc_subnet" {
  name            = "testsubnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.testacc_vpc.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_lb" "testacc_lb" {
  name    = "testlb"
  subnets = [ibm_is_subnet.testacc_subnet.id]
}

data "ibm_is_lb" "ds_lb" {
  name = ibm_is_lb.testacc_lb.name
}
```
